# Chicken and Corn Velouté

**Ingredients:**
- **2 egg whites**
- **1 can of cream-style corn**
- **4 cups chicken broth**
- **2 tablespoons cornstarch**
- **1/4 pound chicken breast, boneless, skinless, finely diced**
- **1 teaspoon soy sauce**
- **Salt, to taste**
- **3 teaspoons water**
- **1/4 cup finely chopped cooked ham (optional)**

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Chicken Mixture:**
   - Beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks.
   - Gently fold in the finely diced chicken breast. Set aside.

2. **Blend the Corn and Broth:**
   - In a blender, combine 1 cup of cream-style corn with 1 cup of chicken broth. Blend until smooth.
   - Pour the blended mixture into a saucepan, then add the remaining corn and chicken broth.

3. **Season and Thicken:**
   - Add soy sauce and salt to the saucepan, adjusting to your taste.
   - Gradually heat the mixture, allowing the flavors to meld.
   - In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with water until smooth. Slowly stir this into the soup, continuing to cook until the soup thickens slightly.

4. **Incorporate the Chicken-Egg White Mixture:**
   - Add the chicken and egg white mixture to the soup, blending well.

5. **Final Cook:**
   - Cook the soup on medium heat for about 5 minutes, ensuring it doesn’t reach a boil.
   - If making ahead of time, reheat the soup gently on low heat before serving.

6. **Garnish and Serve:**
   - Pour the soup into a warm serving dish or tureen.
   - For an extra touch, sprinkle with finely chopped ham if desired.
